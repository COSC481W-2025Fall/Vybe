## ðŸ“Œ Team Info  

**Team Name:** Vybe  

**Team Policies:**  

- **Absence Policy:** Absences are acceptable for illness, emergencies, or mental health days, provided they are not too frequent. Team members must always check in with the team leader whenever they are going to be absent.  

- **Ethic Policy:**  
  - *Unintentional issues:* minimal damage or deletion will result in a verbal warning, while major damage or deletion will be escalated to the team leader.  
  - *Intentional issues:* minimal damage or deletion will be escalated directly to the team leader, and major damage or deletion will be escalated to the professor.  
  - All infractions will be formally recorded.  

- **Language Policy:** English is the only language to be used, as the team does not share enough common experience in any other language to ensure clear communication.  

- **Code/Work Modification Guidelines:** Always create and work from branches, and make sure to pull frequently to stay up to date. Get permission before making any major changes, and always add commentsâ€”if itâ€™s a minor change, include a short tagline explaining what was updated. Keep your section primary informed by posting updates in the Discord chat, and check in daily. Each section will maintain its own branch, with every member working from an individual sub-branch.  

- **Face Mask Policy:** Wearing a face mask is not required, but team members are free to wear one if they choose.  

- **Grade/Contribution Policy:** A student must have all peer reviews agree that they are contributing fairly to the project in order to meet expectations. If intentional damage occurs, it may result in a lower grade based on a consensus between the co-leaders and the respective primaries of the section involved, unless those individuals are themselves the ones in question. If the damage is unintentional, more than three recorded instances will also result in a lower score. Therefore, earning a grade of B- or higher requires that students avoid both intentional and repeated unintentional damage and contribute fairly to the project.  

- **Communication Standards:** All primary communication will take place through the Discord server. For section-specific matters, use your designated channel, as category and channel names are self-explanatory. Team members must keep Discord notifications on and ensure they are functioning at all times, though it is acceptable to mute lounge or unrelated technical discussion channels if desired. Response times are preferred to be within 3 hours, but end of day is the latest acceptable deadline. Transcripts will be recorded for each official meeting. Meeting schedules will be set weekly, with two meetings per week to ensure regular communication with the team leader and co-leader. Each member must attend at least one meeting per week.
